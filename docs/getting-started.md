# Installation & Setup

## What yolobox does

yolobox runs an AI coding agent inside a container where:

- your project is mounted at its real path
- the agent has full permissions and sudo inside the box
- your home directory is not mounted unless you explicitly opt in
- named volumes preserve tools and session state across runs

The default workflow is simple:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
yolobox claude
```

Use `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `opencode`, or `copilot` depending on the tool you want to run.

## Install

### Homebrew

```bash
brew install finbarr/tap/yolobox
```

### Install script

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/finbarr/yolobox/master/install.sh | bash
```

The install script downloads a release binary when one is available for your platform. If it cannot, it falls back to building from source.

## First run

Start from any project:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
yolobox claude
```

Other common entry points:

```bash
yolobox codex
yolobox gemini
yolobox copilot
yolobox run make test
yolobox
```

Use `yolobox` by itself when you want a shell. Use `yolobox run ...` when you want one command. Use the AI shortcuts when you want the intended workflow.

## Runtime support

yolobox auto-detects the first supported runtime it can use.

| Platform | Supported runtimes |
|---|---|
| macOS | Docker Desktop, OrbStack, Colima, Apple container (macOS Tahoe+) |
| Linux | Docker, Podman |

Force a runtime explicitly:

```bash
yolobox claude --runtime docker
yolobox claude --runtime podman
yolobox claude --runtime container
```

::: warning Memory requirements
Claude Code needs at least 4 GB of RAM allocated to Docker. Colima defaults to 2 GB, which often leads to OOM kills.

```bash
colima stop && colima start --memory 8
```
